## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- `chart_snapshot_display` (metered): a JPEG of what a display shows, taken
  now and kept nowhere. The agent's reply is validated as untrusted input -
  JPEG data URL, bounded size, real JPEG bytes - before it is returned.
- `chart_forget_display` (free): removes one of the caller's displays, its
  queued commands and pairing rows, and its vault secret. A name shared by
  several displays is refused; name one by its agent_id.

### Changed
- `chart_pair_agent`, `chart_agent_status` and `chart_forget_display` now
  require a proof of the caller's npub. Before, anyone knowing an npub could
  list its displays.
- A metered call to a display that never answers, or to a display name the
  caller does not have, is refunded. It used to return `ok: false` and keep
  the fare.
- When several displays share a name, commands go to the connected one.
